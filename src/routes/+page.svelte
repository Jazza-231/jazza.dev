      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
         My name is Jarrad, and I am an {age} year old beginner programmer. I began
         to learn programming about {age - 17 === 1
            ? "1 year"
            : age - 17 + " years"} ago, starting with JS in order to contribute to
         the Scratch Addons project.
      </p>
      <p>
         My relationship with programming is one of immense love-filled hatred.
         <br />
         Looking at you CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
         I currently attend a TAFE institution in Western Australia for a music
         technology course, another of my passions. When I'm not studying there,
         I am coding. I am still 100% a beginner, and am currently learning
         svelte+kit. When I am not studying or coding, I am probably gaming. I
         play relatively popular games, such as Red Dead Redemption 2, CS2,
         Forza Horizon 5, and Cyberpunk 2077. You can check out screenshots <a
